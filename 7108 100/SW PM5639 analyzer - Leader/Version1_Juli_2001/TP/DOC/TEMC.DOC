Turbo Editor macros
===========================================================================

          TEMC.EXE is an editor macro compiler for the IDE. It
          processes a script file that defines editor macros and
          key bindings, and produces a configuration file that is
          read by the IDE to define the effects of keyboard
          commands in the editor.

          The file DEFAULTS.TEM contains the default macro
          definitions and key bindings built into the IDE editor.
          It serves as an example script, as well as a base from
          which to customize the editor. Several other .TEM files
          are also provided for your convenience.

===========================================================================
TEMC command line
===========================================================================

          TEMC is invoked from the DOS command line. Type

              temc [-c] <script file>[.TEM] <config file><.TP>

          The script file extension is assumed to be .TEM if not
          otherwise specified. The configuration file extension
          must be .TP.

          TEMC requires that you have an existing .TP file, which
          will be used to store the new key bindings from your
          script.  You must specify the name of your .TP file
          when invoking TEMC.

          The optional -c switch can also be specified as /c, and
          can appear in any argument position on the command
          line. If you use this option, any existing command
          table in your configuration file is thrown away before
          TEMC processes the script file. When -c is not used,
          the key bindings in the script file are merged with
          those already defined in the configuration file.

          You can use DEFAULTS.TEM to re-create exactly the
          default settings of the editor command set. This
          file is included as both a sample script file and as
          the default command table. You can copy it and modify
          it for your own use.

===========================================================================
Syntax
===========================================================================

          The syntax to define a macro is

              MACRO <macroname>
                <command1>;
                [ <command2>; ... ]
              END;

          <macroname> can consist of anything that is a legal C
          symbol, and <command> can be either the name of another
          predefined macro or a predefined TEMC editor command. A
          list of editor commands and what they do follows.

          When you define your macro, the following points are
          valid:

          1. A statement defines either a named macro or a key
             binding.

          2. Spaces and new lines are optional.

          3. Comments are in C-style /* ... */ pairs.

          4. Unlike C, TEMC's language is case insensitive.

          5. Some of the predefined editor commands have a syntax
             that looks like a C function call with one argument.
             For example,

                 SetMark(5);

             Depending on the command, the argument is either a
             decimal integer constant, a character constant, or a
             string literal. All are specified using C syntax.

          Here's an example of a macro definition from
          DEFAULTS.TEM:

              MACRO MacScrollUp
                ScrollScreenUp; FixCursorPos;
              END;

          The syntax to define a key binding is

              <key-sequence>: <command>;

             or

              <key-sequence>: BEGIN <command1>; [ <command2>; ... ]
              END;

          The <key-sequence> is either a key (a character
          optionally preceded by Ctrl or Alt), or a series of
          keys separated by a plus sign (+). Note that the
          specification of the key characters themselves is case
          sensitive. For example, Ctrl+k B is different than
          Ctrl+k b, even though the latter is the same as Ctrl+K b.

          White space is allowed between the key-sequence and the
          colon, and each <command> can be either the name of a
          previously defined macro, or one of the predefined
          editor commands listed in Table 1.1.

===========================================================================
Key codes
===========================================================================

          The IDE editor makes use of an extended character set
          that includes key combinations not normally available
          to DOS programs. Key codes can be specified in a script
          through any combination of the symbols "Ctrl+", "Shift+",
          "Alt+" and a character.

          Some keys cannot be entered directly into a TEMC
          script. Those keys can be referred to by their names,
          as described in the following table.

          Any key in a sequence--except the first key--can be
          preceded by one of the characters ^ or @. The caret (^)
          indicates that any combination of case and "Ctrl" can
          be used to type the key; that is, lowercase, uppercase,
          or control characters. The @ sign is used to indicate
          that case is insignificant for the following character,
          although "Ctrl" is not accepted. For example,

          * Ctrl+k b specifies a Ctrl+K followed by a lowercase b.

          * Ctrl+k ^b specifies a Ctrl+K followed by any of b, B,
            or Ctrl+B.

          * Ctrl+k @B specifies Ctrl+K followed by either b or B.

     Named keys

          Key are specified as letters, numbers, or characters,
          optionally preceded by one or more of Ctrl+, Alt+ or
          Shift+. The following names specify keys that cannot be
          typed as themselves in the TEMC syntax.

Predefined editor commands
===========================================================================

          TEMC lets you use built-in editor commands and user-
          defined macros as commands within macros interchangeably
          as long as you don't create any loops by having two
          macros calling each other, even via intermediate macros.
          Note that some commands cause an escape from the editor
          to the surrounding IDE, for example, by bringing up a
          dialog box. Your macro will "pause" until control returns
          to the editor.

          A list of all predefined TEMC editor commands is shown
          next. Commands that cause an escape from the editor
          follow.

     TEMC editor commands

          -------------------------------------------------------
          Command name                What the editor does
          -------------------------------------------------------

          BackspaceDelete             Deletes character before
                                      the cursor.

          BottomOfScreen              Moves cursor to the bottom
                                      line of the current window,
                                      leaving column unchanged.

          CenterFixScreenPos          Adjusts the screen display
                                      to ensure the cursor is
                                      visible. If any adjustment
                                      is necessary, adjust the
                                      display so the cursor is
                                      close to being centered in
                                      the window.

          CopyBlock                   If there is a valid and
                                      highlighted (selected)
                                      text block, then at the
                                      cursor location, inserts a
                                      copy of the characters that
                                      are selected and makes that
                                      the new selected text
                                      location.

          CursorCharLeft              Moves cursor left over one
                                      character. This command
                                      will skip over tab
                                      characters and move to the
                                      end of the previous line.

          CursorCharRight             Moves cursor right over one
                                      character. This  command
                                      will skip over tab
                                      characters and advance to
                                      the beginning of the next
                                      line.

          CursorDown                  Moves cursor down one row.

          CursorLeft                  Moves cursor left one
                                      screen column.

          CursorRight                 Moves cursor right one
                                      screen column.

          CursorSwitchedLeft          Like CursorLeft, but pays
                                      attention to cursor through
                                      tab option setting (see
                                      SetCursorThroughTabMode).

          CursorSwitchedRight         Like CursorRight, but pays
                                      attention to cursor
                                      through tab option setting
                                      (see SetCursorThroughTabMode).

          CursorUp                    Moves cursor up one row.

          DeleteBlock                 If there is a valid and
                                      highlighted (selected) text
                                      block, deletes the
                                      characters that are in it.

          DeleteChar                  Deletes the character at
                                      the current cursor
                                      location.

          DeleteLine                  Deletes the current line.

          DeleteToEOL                 Deletes all characters in
                                      the current line, leaving a
                                      zero-length line.

          DeleteWord                  Deletes from cursor to
                                      beginning of next word.

          EndCursor                   Moves cursor to end of file
                                      buffer.

          ExtendBlockBeg              Initiates a series of
                                      commands that will select a
                                      block of text between the
                                      initial and ending
                                      positions of the cursor.

          ExtendBlockEnd              Ends a series of commands
                                      begun by ExtendBlockBeg.

          FixCursorPos                Ensures that the cursor
                                      value specifies a row
                                      between 1 and the number of
                                      lines in the buffer, a
                                      column greater than 0. If
                                      the cursor through tab
                                      option is not set, the
                                      cursor is not placed in the
                                      middle of a tab character
                                      (see SetCursorThroughTabMode).

          FixScreenPos                Adjusts the screen display
                                      to ensure the cursor is
                                      visible.

          FullPaintScreen             Redraws the entire window,
                                      making no assumptions about
                                      what is onscreen.

          HideBlock                   Sets a flag indicating that
                                      the selected text should
                                      not be highlighted.

          HighlightBlock              Sets a flag indicating that
                                      if the beginning and end
                                      selected text markers are
                                      valid, the selected text
                                      should be highlighted.

          HomeCursor                  Moves cursor to beginning
                                      of the file buffer.

          IndentBlock                 Inserts a space at the
                                      beginning of each line in
                                      the highlighted (selected)
                                      text.

          InsertText                  Inserts the literal
                                      "string" in the buffer at
                                      the current cursor
                                      location. Use the syntax
                                      InsertText(string) to call
                                      this command.

          LeftOfLine                  Moves cursor to beginning
                                      of the current line.

          LiteralChar                 Inserts the character at
                                      the current cursor
                                      location, without doing any
                                      special processing for
                                      newline, tab characters,
                                      etc. Use the syntax
                                      LiteralChar(c), where c is
                                      a character or integer
                                      value.

          MarkBufModified             Sets a flag indicating that
                                      the contents of the buffer
                                      are different than what is
                                      in the corresponding disk
                                      file.

          MarkBufUnModified           Clears a flag, thus
                                      indicating that the
                                      contents of the buffer can
                                      be assumed to be identical
                                      to what is in the disk
                                      file.

          MatchPairBackward           Same as MatchPairForward
                                      except if the cursor is on
                                      a ' or ", searches backward
                                      for the matching character.

          MatchPairForward            If the cursor is on one of
                                      the characters (, ), {, },
                                      [, ], or on the first
                                      character of one of the
                                      pairs /* or */, searches in
                                      the appropriate direction
                                      for the closest instance of
                                      the matching delimiter. If
                                      the cursor is on the
                                      character ' or ", searches
                                      forward for the matching
                                      character. If a match is
                                      found, places the cursor
                                      there.

          MoveBlock                   Like CopyBlock, but also

                                      SetMark(n) command. Use the
                                      syntax MoveToMark(n), where
                                      n is a one-digit number, 0-9.

                                      editor, but performs no
                                      function. Can be used to
                                      cause a keystroke to have
                                      no effect.

          OutdentBlock                Deletes a leading space, if
                                      any, from the beginning of
                                      each line in the
                                      highlighted (selected)
                                      text.

                                      numer of lines in the
                                      window, leaving cursor
                                      position unchanged.

          PageScreenUp                Scrolls screen up by numer
                                      of lines in the window,

                                      assuming that the screen
                                      still correctly displays
                                      what the editor last drew
                                      on it.

          ReDo                        Performs an Redo operation.
                                      Exactly what happens
                                      depends on the option
                                      settings.

                                      cursor location.

          SetBlockEnd                 Sets the end of the
                                      selected text to be the
                                      character at the current

                                      current cursor location, so
                                      a later MoveToMark(n)
                                      command can restore the
                                      cursor. Use the syntax
                                      SetMark(n), where n is a

                                      in a temporary marker that
                                      can be used by some
                                      internal editor commands.
                                      This is not a practical
                                      application in user-defined
                                      macros. Use SetMark instead.

          -------------------------------------------------------

          The following commands cause an exit from the editor,
          for example, by bringing up a dialog box. The macro
          resumes when the editor window regains the focus.

          The keys listed next to some of the commands below are
          the ones used by default.

          -------------------------------------------------------
