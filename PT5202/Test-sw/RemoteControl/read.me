**********************************************************
To upload program version 5.1 into PT5201/LT428 FLASH program memory:

- Copy the following files to one directory:
  loadall.exe - loader program
  load51.ini - .ini file for loader.exe
  520151.hex - Software ver. 5.1 in hex format
  
- Power down the PT5201/LT428.
- Remove the top cover from generator.
- Install the PP2 jumper.
- Connect serial cable between the generator and your com-
  puter's COM1 serial port.
- Apply power to the generator.
  Leds D28 and D31 should blink together.
  
- Open a Dos-box under your Window operating system.
- Run the program loadall.exe with the following command line
  parameters:
  loadall load51.ini.
- After approx. 1 minute the program will terminate, writing
  "...uploaded." on the screen.
- The new software version is now downloaded and ready to use.
- Switch the PT5201 generator off.
- Remove the PP2 jumper.
- Switch the generator on.
  The D28 LED should blink, which indicates that the new 
  software executes corrcectly.

To verify if the program download was successfull the program checksums
can be veryfied from a serial terminal program like Windows Hypertermina.      
(This verification is optionally. Is only recomanted to use if there is
any reasons to belive that the download procedure was curropted) 
 
The verification is done as follow:
 
- set the terminal to 115200, n, 8, 2.
- Power down the PT5201/LT428.
- Verify that the PP2 jumper is installed.
- Apply power to the generator.
  Leds D28 and D31 should blink together.
- issue the commands at the end of this document and check 
  that the PT5201/LT428 generator responds as required.  Each 
  command should be ended with 'RETURN' key.
- If the checksums are incorrect, repeat the download procedure.     
- Switch the PT5201 generator off.
- Remove the PP2 jumper.
- Switch the generator on.
  The D28 LED should blink, which indicates that the new 
  software executes corrcectly.
- Now software revision number, which is stored in PT5201 non-volatile
  memory, will have to be updated.  This involves issuing commands via
  SCPI interface, as described under the "Remote Interface" in the 
  Operatin Manual.  Proceed as follows:
  - Set your terminal to 96,n,8,2.
  - Write:
    *IDN?
    The PT5201 should respond with its id string.
  - Write:
    :FACT:PASS 'PASS5201'
    :FACT:MAIN:IDN:SWR 051
  - The revision number should now be updated inside the PT5201.
  - Write:
    *IDN?
    and verify that the PT5201 responds with new revision number.
