8.05.2003: Version 4.

1. Transparent mode implemented in serial routines. Was not implemented
   in version 3, so it was impossible to upload SPG and BB software.
2. In uart1_init(), S1STAT is now set to 0, transmission errors will NOT
   cause serial1 receive interrupt.

The program was tested for proper function of transparent mode in the 
following way:

On HP computer, transparent mode was entered via a terminal and then 
loadall.exe was used to upload SPG and BB.

The same method was used on 5202 test computer in production dept.

On hardware computer this method did not work, there were errors in 
transmission.  When loading prigram hex file to master with loadall.exe there
were no problems.  It was, however, possible to upload SPG and BB with
Hyperterminal.  The same problem was observed (downloading SPG and BB)
when PT5201 software ver.5.3 was loaded into the generator.

04.12.2003: Version 5.

Command handler in rs232par.c is modified to allow 16 character text
string to be entered via serial interface (CmdSyntax()).

New video data file, which was synthesized once again in order to
correct an error in data.
