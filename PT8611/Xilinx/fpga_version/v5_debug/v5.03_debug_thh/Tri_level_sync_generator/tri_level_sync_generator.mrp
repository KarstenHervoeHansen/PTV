NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity -
   e.g. two LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.
   When assembling slices, Map gives priority to combine logic that
   is related.  Doing so results in the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin
   packing unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are
   occupied through related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through
   related logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely
   utilized.  Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until
   all usable LUTs and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing
   budget, increased levels of unrelated logic packing may adversely
   affect the overall timing performance of your design.

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:LIT:176 - Clock buffer is designated to drive clock loads. BUFGMUX
   symbol "physical_group_f8g_BUFGP/f8g_BUFGP/BUFG" (output signal=f8g_BUFGP)
   has a mix of clock and non-clock loads. The non-clock loads are:
   Pin I1 of trilevel_syncgenerator2__n0022_SW0
   Pin I1 of trilevel_syncgenerator4__n0022_SW0
   Pin I1 of trilevel_syncgenerator1__n0022_SW0
   Pin I1 of trilevel_syncgenerator3__n0022_SW0

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:LIT:95 - All of the external outputs in this design are using slew rate
   limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical outputs can be
   dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs in the schematic.
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:MapLib:535 - The following Virtex BUFG(s) is/are being retargetted to
   Virtex2 BUFGMUX(s) with input tied to I0 and Select pin tied to constant 0:
   BUFGP symbol "f27_BUFGP" (output signal=f27_BUFGP),
   BUFGP symbol "f8g_BUFGP" (output signal=f8g_BUFGP),
   BUFGP symbol "sck_BUFGP" (output signal=sck_BUFGP)

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
