Revision for PT8612 PCB rev. 0


1. Missing connection R48, R49, R50 to +5V.
2. Missing JTAG for micro-controller
3. Missing connection between FPGA DI pin to PROM D0 pin.
4. Missing Thevenin parallel termination for CCLK net between FPGA and PROM. (100R pull up and 100R pull down resistor)
5. Cover via under FBGA package chips.
6. Suggested C8051F320 used instead of C8051F210. USB interface.
7. NSS7 in mc firmware is output from pin 0.2, which is not connected to FPGA. NSS7 is not used in this program(chip select NSS0-NSS3 used). Consider pin change in mc firmware.
8. RED0 missing on FPGA. Wrong connection on pin AA17 of FPGA.
9. RocketIO clock input pins MGT_CLK are not connected.
10. Output1 is not connected with gennum output driver.
