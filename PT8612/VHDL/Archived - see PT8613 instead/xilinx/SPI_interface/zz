Where:
  -d            = Don't Run DRC (Design Rules Checker)
  -j            = Don't create bit file
  -b            = Create rawbits file
  -w            = Overwrite existing output file
  -l            = Create logic allocation file
  -m            = Create mask file
  -t            = Tie down unused interconnect
  -n            = Save tied ncd as _<file>.ncd
  -u            = Use critical nets as last resort during tiedown
  -a            = Attempt "full" tiedown, allowing use of user signals
  -f <cmdfile>  = Read command line arguments from file <cmdfile>
  -r <bitfile>  = Create a partial bit file using <bitfile> as reference
  -bd <memfile> = Update BlockRAM contents with data from file <memfile>
  -g <opt:val>  = Set architecture specific option "opt" to value "val"

Use "bitgen -help <architecture>" to display architecture specific options.

BITGEN:  Creates the configuration (BIT) file based on the contents of a
physical implementation file (NCD).  The BIT file defines the behavior of
the programmed FPGA.
