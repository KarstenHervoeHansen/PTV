NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:LIT:243 - Logical network serial_interfacing/chan2_param_ram/doutb<7>
   has no load.
WARNING:LIT:374 - The above warning message base_net_load_rule is repeated 47
   more times for the following (max. 5 shown):
   serial_interfacing/chan2_param_ram/doutb<6>,
   serial_interfacing/chan2_param_ram/doutb<5>,
   serial_interfacing/chan2_param_ram/doutb<4>,
   serial_interfacing/chan2_param_ram/doutb<3>,
   serial_interfacing/chan2_param_ram/doutb<2>
   To see the details of these warning messages, please use the -detail switch.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:MapLib:535 - The following Virtex BUFG(s) is/are being retargetted to
   Virtex2 BUFGMUX(s) with input tied to I0 and Select pin tied to constant 0:
   BUFG symbol "clk1_for_logic" (output signal=clk1),
   BUFG symbol "clk2_for_logic" (output signal=clk2),
   BUFG symbol "debug_slow_clock" (output signal=debug_clk)
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs in the
   schematic.
INFO:LIT:66 - BUFGMUX chain detected. Two or more BUFMGUXs are connected in
   series. Because non-standard routing resources must be used to connect the
   BUFGMUXs, this chain can result in: 1) skew between the clocks derived from
   outputs of different stages of this chain, and/or 2) skew between the
   resulting clock and clocks that use other BUFGMUX paths.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
 125 block(s) removed
  54 block(s) optimized away
 160 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).
