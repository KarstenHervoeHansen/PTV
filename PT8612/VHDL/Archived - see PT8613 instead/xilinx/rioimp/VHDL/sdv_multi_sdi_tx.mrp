NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity -
   e.g. two LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.
   When assembling slices, Map gives priority to combine logic that
   is related.  Doing so results in the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin
   packing unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are
   occupied through related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through
   related logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely
   utilized.  Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until
   all usable LUTs and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing
   budget, increased levels of unrelated logic packing may adversely
   affect the overall timing performance of your design.

Section 2 - Warnings
--------------------
WARNING:MapLib:37 - The GSR pin on STARTUP_VIRTEX2 symbol "STARTV2" (output
   signal=<none>) has driving signal 'n_pb1'.  Redundant connections of signal
   'n_pb1' to other symbols have been removed.  See the following warnings for
   more details.
WARNING:DesignRules:332 - Blockcheck: Dangling RAMB16B output. Pin DOB14 of comp

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:LIT:95 - All of the external outputs in this design are using slew rate
   limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical outputs can be
   dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs in the schematic.
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:MapLib:533 - The following XORCY(s) is/are demoted to LUTs because there is
   no MUXCY associated with them. Therefore, we cannot recognize the standard
   carry chain structure (5 of 6 are listed):
   XORCY symbol "EDH_MUX_INSERT_anc_insert__n0043<10>_xor" (output
   signal=EDH_MUX_INSERT__n0043<10>),
   XORCY symbol "EDH_MUX_INSERT_anc_insert__n0043<11>_xor" (output
   signal=EDH_MUX_INSERT__n0043<11>),
   XORCY symbol "EDH_MUX_INSERT_anc_insert__n0043<6>_xor" (output
   signal=EDH_MUX_INSERT__n0043<6>),
   XORCY symbol "EDH_MUX_INSERT_anc_insert__n0043<7>_xor" (output
   signal=EDH_MUX_INSERT__n0043<7>),
   XORCY symbol "EDH_MUX_INSERT_anc_insert__n0043<8>_xor" (output
   signal=EDH_MUX_INSERT__n0043<8>)

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
   4 block(s) removed
   2 block(s) optimized away
  81 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).
