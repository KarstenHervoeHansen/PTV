NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.

Mapping completed.

INFO:Par:62 - Your design did not meet timing.  The following are some
   suggestions to assist you to meet timing in your design.
   

   Review the timing report using Timing Analyzer (In ISE select "Post-Place
   & Route Static Timing Report").  Go to the failing constraint(s) and select
   the "Timing Improvement Wizard" link for suggestions to correct each problem.

   Rerun Map with "-timing" (ISE process "Perform Timing -Driven Packing and
Placement"

   Run Multi-Pass Place and Route in PAR using at least 5 "PAR Iterations"
   (ISE process "Multi Pass Place & Route").

   Visit the Xilinx technical support web at http://support.xilinx.com and go
   to either "Troubleshoot->Tech Tips->Timing & Constraints" or
   " TechXclusives->Timing Closure" for tips and suggestions for meeting timing
   in your design.

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.

Mapping completed.

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.

INFO:Par:62 - Your design did not meet timing.  The following are some
   suggestions to assist you to meet timing in your design.
   

   Review the timing report using Timing Analyzer (In ISE select "Post-Place
   & Route Static Timing Report").  Go to the failing constraint(s) and select
   the "Timing Improvement Wizard" link for suggestions to correct each problem.

   Increase the PAR Effort Level setting to "high"

   Rerun Map with "-timing" (ISE process "Perform Timing -Driven Packing and
Placement"

   Run Multi-Pass Place and Route in PAR using at least 5 "PAR Iterations"
   (ISE process "Multi Pass Place & Route").
