NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.

WARNING:LIT:243 - Logical network f7417 has no load.
WARNING:LIT:374 - The above warning message base_net_load_rule is repeated 6
   more times for the following (max. 5 shown):
   f7425,

   To see the details of these warning messages, please use the -detail switch.
WARNING:PhysDesignRules:367 - The signal <TXn_OUT_113a/TXn_OUT_113a> is
   incomplete. The signal does not drive any load pins in the design.

Section 3 - Informational
-------------------------
INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.
INFO:MapLib:159 - Net Timing constraints on signal f1485 are pushed forward
   through input buffer.
INFO:MapLib:159 - Net Timing constraints on signal f1484 are pushed forward
   through input buffer.
INFO:MapLib:533 - The following XORCY(s) is/are demoted to LUTs because there is
   no MUXCY associated with them. Therefore, we cannot recognize the standard
   carry chain structure (5 of 24 are listed):
   XORCY symbol "mod5_hdframe_hd_framegenerator__n0083<10>_xor" (output
   signal=mod5_hdframe__n0083<10>),
   XORCY symbol "mod5_hdframe_hd_framegenerator__n0083<11>_xor" (output
   signal=mod5_hdframe__n0083<11>),
   XORCY symbol "mod5_hdframe_hd_framegenerator__n0083<5>_xor" (output
   signal=mod5_hdframe__n0083<5>),
   XORCY symbol "mod5_hdframe_hd_framegenerator__n0083<6>_xor" (output
   signal=mod5_hdframe__n0083<6>),
   XORCY symbol "mod5_hdframe_hd_framegenerator__n0083<7>_xor" (output
   signal=mod5_hdframe__n0083<7>)
INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs in the
   schematic.
