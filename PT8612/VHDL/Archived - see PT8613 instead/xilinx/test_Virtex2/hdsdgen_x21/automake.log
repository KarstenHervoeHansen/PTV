Timing Score: 1725

INFO:Par:62 - Your design did not meet timing.  The following are some
   suggestions to assist you to meet timing in your design.
   

   Review the timing report using Timing Analyzer (In ISE select "Post-Place
   & Route Static Timing Report").  Go to the failing constraint(s) and select
   the "Timing Improvement Wizard" link for suggestions to correct each problem.

   Increase the PAR Effort Level setting to "high"

   Rerun Map with "-timing" (ISE process "Perform Timing -Driven Packing and
Placement"

   Run Multi-Pass Place and Route in PAR using at least 5 "PAR Iterations"
   (ISE process "Multi Pass Place & Route").

   Visit the Xilinx technical support web at http://support.xilinx.com and go
   to either "Troubleshoot->Tech Tips->Timing & Constraints" or
   " TechXclusives->Timing Closure" for tips and suggestions for meeting timing
   in your design.

Asterisk (*) preceding a constraint indicates it was not met.
   This may be due to a setup or hold violation.
