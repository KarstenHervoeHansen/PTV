mathtest.edn:
   Electronic Data Netlist (EDN) file containing the information
   required to implement the module in a Xilinx (R) FPGA.

mathtest.sym:
   Please see the core data sheet.

mathtest.v:
   Verilog wrapper file provided to support functional simulation.
   This file contains simulation model customization data that is
   passed to a parameterized simulation model for the core.

mathtest.veo:
   VEO template file containing code that can be used as a model for
   instantiating a CORE Generator module in a Verilog design.

mathtest.vhd:
   VHDL wrapper file provided to support functional simulation. This
   file contains simulation model customization data that is passed to
   a parameterized simulation model for the core.

mathtest.vho:
   VHO template file containing code that can be used as a model for
   instantiating a CORE Generator module in a VHDL design.

mathtest.xco:
   CORE Generator input file containing the parameters used to
   regenerate a core.

mathtest_flist.txt:
   Text file listing all of the output files produced when a customized
   core was generated in the CORE Generator.
