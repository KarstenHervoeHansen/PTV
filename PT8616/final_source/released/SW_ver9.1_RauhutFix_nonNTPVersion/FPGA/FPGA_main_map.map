ERROR:Pack:18 - The design is too large for the given device and package. 
   Please check the Design Summary section to see which resource requirement for
   your design exceeds the resources available in the device.

   If the slice count exceeds device resources you might try to disable register
   ordering (-r).  Also if your design contains AREA_GROUPs, you may be able to
   improve density by adding COMPRESSION to your AREA_GROUPs if you haven't done
   so already.

   NOTE: An NCD file will still be generated to allow you to examine the mapped
   design.  This file is intended for evaluation use only, and will not process
   successfully through PAR.

   This mapped NCD file can be used to evaluate how the design's logic has been
   mapped into FPGA logic resources.  It can also be used to analyze
   preliminary, logic-level (pre-route) timing with one of the Xilinx static
   timing analysis tools (TRCE or Timing Analyzer).

NOTES:

   Related logic is defined as being logic that shares connectivity - e.g. two
   LUTs are "related" if they share common inputs.  When assembling slices,
   Map gives priority to combine logic that is related.  Doing so results in
   the best timing performance.

   Unrelated logic shares no connectivity.  Map will only begin packing
   unrelated logic into a slice once 99% of the slices are occupied through
   related logic packing.

   Note that once logic distribution reaches the 99% level through related
   logic packing, this does not mean the device is completely utilized.
   Unrelated logic packing will then begin, continuing until all usable LUTs
   and FFs are occupied.  Depending on your timing budget, increased levels of
   unrelated logic packing may adversely affect the overall timing performance
   of your design.
