1.	GRANT OF LICENSE. National Instruments Corporation ("NI") is willing to provide you with a limited, non-exclusive right to use the software program you are installing and related documentation (the "SOFTWARE").  This Agreement permits you to install and use one copy of the SOFTWARE on a single computer in your workplace. The SOFTWARE is in "use" on a computer when it is loaded into temporary memory (i.e., RAM) or installed into permanent memory (e.g., hard disk, CD-ROM, or other storage device). In addition, if you are a business or other entity, the primary user of the single computer on which the SOFTWARE is installed and used may also install and use the SOFTWARE on one computer located in such user's home; provided the use of the SOFTWARE on such home computer is limited to work performed in the scope of such person's employment with you and further provided, such person promptly deletes the SOFTWARE upon the termination of his or her employment with you.  All rights not 
expressly granted to you in this Agreement are reserved to NI.

2.	COPYRIGHT. The SOFTWARE is owned by NI or its suppliers and is protected by United States copyright laws and international treaty provisions.  Therefore, you must treat the SOFTWARE like any other copyrighted material. You may, however, either (a) make one copy of the SOFTWARE solely for backup or archival purposes, or (b) transfer the SOFTWARE to a single hard disk, provided you keep the original solely for backup or archival purposes.  You may not copy the written materials accompanying the SOFTWARE.

3.	OTHER RESTRICTIONS. 

	(A)	Generally. You may not reverse engineer, decompile, or disassemble the SOFTWARE. You may transfer the SOFTWARE to a third party provided that the receiving party accepts the terms and conditions of this Agreement and after such transfer you do not retain any copies of the SOFTWARE, including all upgrades that you may have received, nor retain any of the written materials accompanying the SOFTWARE. You may not lease nor rent the SOFTWARE. Further, for SOFTWARE acquired within the United States, you may not export the SOFTWARE outside of the United States without first complying with all applicable United States export laws and regulations. 

	(B)	Software/Hardware Key. If the SOFTWARE is National Instruments Lookout(TM) software, you acknowledge that the SOFTWARE will not function without a certain, unique software key code. This software key code will be furnished to you by NI and you agree that such software key code is to be used solely with the SOFTWARE for which it is provided. You also acknowledge that the SOFTWARE will not function in certain countries without a certain hardware key. If applicable, this hardware key will be furnished to you by NI and you agree that such hardware key is to be used solely with the SOFTWARE for which it is provided.   The list of countries is as follows and is subject to change from time to time: Albania, Algeria, Angola, Antigua, Argentina, Aruba, Bahamas, Bahrain, Bangladesh, Barbados, Belarus, Bermuda, Bolivia, Bosnia, Botswana, Brazil, Brunei, Bulgaria, Burma, Canary Islands, Chile, China, Colombia, Congo, Costa Rica, Croatia, Cuba, Cyprus, Czech Republic/Slovakia, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt,

4.	STORAGE/NETWORK USE.  While you may install a copy of the SOFTWARE on a storage device (such as a network server) which is used solely to install or run the SOFTWARE on other computers connected to the storage device, you must acquire a separate license from NI for each separate computer on which the SOFTWARE is used from the storage device. You are not authorized under this Agreement to install or use the SOFTWARE on multiple computers (other than the exception for home use as provided in Section 1 above). If you desire to install the SOFTWARE on multiple computers, please contact NI or, if applicable, the NI subsidiary serving your country, in order to acquire the necessary group license from NI. 

5.	MULTIPLE VERSIONS (CD-ROM MEDIA); ACADEMIC USE.  If the SOFTWARE is distributed on a CD-ROM containing multiple versions of the same SOFTWARE program for use with different operating systems, your license grant extends to using only the applicable version of the SOFTWARE specified in your applicable purchase order.  You must contact NI, or if applicable, the NI subsidiary serving your country for prior authorization before using a different version of the SOFTWARE than the version specified in the applicable purchase order.  If you are using the SOFTWARE under an "Educational/Research" license from NI for academic institutions, you must be a qualified academic institution/user. Please contact NI or, if applicable, the NI subsidiary serving your country for more information regarding academic institution use.

6.	COMPONENT PARTS; SUPPLEMENTAL CODE. The SOFTWARE is licensed as a single product. Its component parts may not be separated for use.  Should NI (in its sole discretion) provide you with supplemental code and other materials relating to the SOFTWARE, such supplemental code or materials shall be considered as part of the SOFTWARE and subject to the terms of this Agreement. 

7. 	DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS.  

	(A)	Generally. For SOFTWARE not listed in 7(B) below, you may distribute your application (.exe, .dll, html, .alx, etc.) created with such SOFTWARE and/or utilizing relevant configuration utility executables (i.e., NI-DAQ Utility, VXIEdit, VXItedit, etc.) that are part of such SOFTWARE without royalties or fees to NI, provided that:

	(1) 	your application is not itself a general-purpose development tool, function library, or component for data acquisition or instrument control operations, user interface operations (graphs, strip charts, gauges, meters, etc.), analysis routines, or National Instruments TestStand( sequence files;
	(2) 	you include the following copyright notice, either on-screen in your application's About Box or in your application's written documentation, with each distributed copy of your application: "Copyright (c)[yr] National Instruments Corporation.  All Rights Reserved"; 
	(3) 	you do not use NI's name, logo, or trademarks to market your software program without NI's express prior written permission;
	(4) 	you agree to indemnify, hold harmless, and defend NI (including its officers, directors, employees, agents, and suppliers) ("NI Indemnitees") from and against any claims or lawsuits, including attorney's fees, that arise or result from the use or distribution of your application, AND EVEN IF DUE IN PART TO ANY NI INDEMNITEES' CONCURRENT NEGLIGENCE OR OTHER FAULT OR STRICT LIABILITY WITHOUT REGARD TO FAULT; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT YOUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION OF INDEMNIFICATION SHALL NOT EXTEND TO THE PERCENTAGE OF THE CLAIMANT'S DAMAGES OR INJURIES OR THE SETTLEMENT AMOUNT ATTRIBUTABLE TO ANY NI INDEMNITEES' NEGLIGENCE OR OTHER FAULT OR TO STRICT LIABILITY IMPOSED UPON A NI INDEMNITEE AS A MATTER OF LAW; and
	(5)	if you are using Microsoft SDK files or other third party files, you must conform to the requirements described in the SDKLIC.TXT or the other applicable files.

(B)	Run-Time License Required. If the SOFTWARE is National Instruments LabVIEW(TM) RT, National Instruments SQL Toolkit, National Instruments IMAQ(TM) Vision, National Instruments TestStand(TM), National Instruments Test Executive, National Instruments Lookout(TM), or such other software product as NI may from time to time designate as requiring a separate run-time license for application execution, you may not distribute applications (.exe, .dll, html, .alx, etc.) created with (or if applicable, utilizing) such SOFTWARE unless: (1) the end-user of the application has acquired a separate run-time license from National Instruments for the applicable SOFTWARE for each computer on which the application is used and (2) you comply with the provisions of 7(A)(1), (2), (3), (4) and (5) above. Please contact NI or, if applicable, the NI subsidiary serving your country for more information regarding the current list of software requiring separate run-time licenses for application distribution and obtaining applicable run-time licenses.

8.  	LIMITED WARRANTY. NI warrants, for your benefit alone, that for a period of ninety (90) days from the date the SOFTWARE is shipped to you (a) the SOFTWARE will perform substantially in accordance with the accompanying written materials, and (b) the medium on which the SOFTWARE is recorded will be free from defects in materials and workmanship under normal use and service. Any replacement SOFTWARE will be warranted for the remainder of the original warranty period or thirty (30) days, whichever is longer.  Some states/jurisdictions do not allow limitations on duration of an implied warranty, so the above limitation may not apply to you. You must obtain a Return Material Authorization number from NI before returning the SOFTWARE under warranty to NI and you agree to pay expenses for shipment to and from NI. The Limited Warranty is void if failure of the SOFTWARE has resulted from accident, abuse, misapplication, improper calibration by you, third party products (i.e., hardware or software) used by you which are not intended by National Instruments for use with the SOFTWARE, utilization of an improper hardware or software key (if applicable), or unauthorized maintenance of the SOFTWARE.

9.	CUSTOMER REMEDIES. NI's sole obligation (and your sole remedy) with respect to the foregoing Limited Warranty shall be to, at NI's option, return the fees paid or repair/replace the SOFTWARE, provided that NI receives written notice of applicable defects during the warranty period. You may not bring an action to enforce your remedies under the foregoing Limited Warranty more than one (1) year after the accrual of such cause of action.  

10.	NO OTHER WARRANTIES. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY SET FORTH ABOVE, THE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, AND NO OTHER WARRANTIES, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED ARE MADE WITH RESPECT TO THE SOFTWARE, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ANY IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, TITLE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT, OR ANY OTHER WARRANTIES THAT MAY ARISE FROM USAGE OF TRADE OR COURSE OF DEALING.  NI DOES NOT WARRANT, GUARANTEE, OR MAKE ANY REPRESENTATIONS REGARDING THE USE OF OR THE RESULTS OF THE USE OF THE SOFTWARE IN TERMS OF CORRECTNESS, ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, OR OTHERWISE AND DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE.  NI EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTIES NOT STATED HEREIN. 

11.	NO LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES. The entire liability of NI and its licensors, distributors, and suppliers (including its and their directors, officers, employees, and agents) is set forth above. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, in no event shall NI and its licensors, distributors, and suppliers (including its and their directors, officers, employees, and agents) be liable for any damages, including, but not limited to, any special, direct, indirect, incidental, exemplary, or consequential damages, expenses, lost profits, lost savings, business interruption, lost business information, or any other damages arising out of the use or inability to use the SOFTWARE, even if NI or its licensors, distributors, and suppliers has been advised of the possibility of such damages.  You acknowledge that the license fee for the SOFTWARE reflects this allocation of risk.  Because some states/jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of liability for consequential or incidental damages, the above limitation may not apply.  If the foregoing limitation of liability is not enforceable because the SOFTWARE is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final, non-appealable judgment to be defective and to have directly caused bodily injury, death, or property damage, in no event shall NI's liability for property damage exceed the greater of $50,000 or the license fee paid for the SOFTWARE.

12.	WARNING: (1) NI PRODUCTS ARE NOT DESIGNED WITH COMPONENTS AND TESTING FOR A LEVEL OF RELIABILITY SUITABLE FOR USE IN OR IN CONNECTION WITH SURGICAL IMPLANTS OR AS CRITICAL COMPONENTS IN ANY LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEMS WHOSE FAILURE TO PERFORM CAN REASONABLY BE EXPECTED TO CAUSE SIGNIFICANT INJURY TO A HUMAN.  (2) IN ANY APPLICATION, INCLUDING THE ABOVE, RELIABILITY OF OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE PRODUCTS CAN BE IMPAIRED BY ADVERSE FACTORS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO FLUCTUATIONS IN ELECTRICAL POWER SUPPLY, COMPUTER HARDWARE MALFUNCTIONS, COMPUTER OPERATING SYSTEM SOFTWARE FITNESS, FITNESS OF COMPILERS AND DEVELOPMENT SOFTWARE USED TO DEVELOP AN APPLICATION, INSTALLATION ERRORS, SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE COMPATIBILITY PROBLEMS, MALFUNCTIONS OR FAILURES OF ELECTRONIC MONITORING OR CONTROL DEVICES, TRANSIENT FAILURES OF ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS (HARDWARE AND/OR SOFTWARE), UNANTICIPATED USES OR MISUSES, OR ERRORS ON THE PART OF THE USER OR APPLICATIONS DESIGNER (ADVERSE FACTORS SUCH AS THESE ARE 
HEREAFTER COLLECTIVELY TERMED "SYSTEM FAILURES").  ANY APPLICATION WHERE A SYSTEM FAILURE WOULD CREATE A RISK OF HARM TO PROPERTY OR PERSONS (INCLUDING THE RISK OF BODILY INJURY AND DEATH) SHOULD NOT BE RELIANT SOLELY UPON ONE FORM OF ELECTRONIC SYSTEM DUE TO THE RISK OF SYSTEM FAILURE.  TO AVOID DAMAGE, INJURY, OR DEATH, THE USER OR APPLICATION DESIGNER MUST TAKE REASONABLY PRUDENT STEPS TO PROTECT AGAINST SYSTEM FAILURES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO BACK-UP OR SHUT DOWN MECHANISMS.  BECAUSE EACH END-USER SYSTEM IS CUSTOMIZED AND DIFFERS FROM NI'S TESTING PLATFORMS AND BECAUSE A USER OR APPLICATION DESIGNER MAY USE NI PRODUCTS IN COMBINATION WITH OTHER PRODUCTS IN A MANNER NOT EVALUATED OR CONTEMPLATED BY NI, THE USER OR APPLICATION DESIGNER IS ULTIMATELY RESPONSIBLE FOR VERIFYING AND VALIDATING THE SUITABILITY OF NI PRODUCTS WHENEVER NI PRODUCTS ARE INCORPORATED IN A SYSTEM OR APPLICATION, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE APPROPRIATE DESIGN, PROCESS AND SAFETY LEVEL OF SUCH SYSTEM OR APPLICATION.

13.	U.S. GOVERNMENT RESTRICTED RIGHTS.  The SOFTWARE is provided with RESTRICTED RIGHTS.  Use, duplication, or disclosure by the Government is subject to restrictions as set forth in the Rights in Technical Data and Computer Software clause at DFARS 252.227-7013(c)(1)(ii) or the Commercial Computer Software - Restricted Rights clause at 48 CFR 52.227-19(c)(2), or clause 18-52.227-86(d) of the NASA Supplement, as applicable.

15.	GENERAL.  THIS AGREEMENT IS GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS, EXCLUSIVE OF ANY PROVISIONS OF THE UNITED NATIONS CONVENTION ON THE INTERNATIONAL SALE OF GOODS, AND WITHOUT REGARD TO PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW, AND CONSTITUTES THE COMPLETE AGREEMENT BETWEEN YOU AND NI.  IT SUPERSEDES ANY ORAL OR WRITTEN PROPOSALS, PRIOR AGREEMENTS, PURCHASE ORDERS OR ANY OTHER COMMUNICATION BETWEEN YOU AND NI RELATING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT. This Agreement shall automatically terminate upon failure by you to comply with its terms, in which event you must destroy all copies of the SOFTWARE.  If any action is brought by either party to this Agreement against the other regarding the subject matter hereof, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover, in addition to any relief granted, reasonable attorney fees and court costs.  If any provision of this Agreement is held invalid, the offending clause will be modified so as to be 
enforceable and, as modified, shall be fully enforced, and the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect. Product and company names used herein are trademarks or trade names of their respective companies.
