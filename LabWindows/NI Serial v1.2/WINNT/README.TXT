Thank you for purchasing this Serial interface board and the NI Serial
software for Microsoft Windows NT 4.0.

Note 1: For all users
---------------------------
NI Serial software assigns COM port numbers starting at COM5. However,
Windows NT does not allow you to use COM port numbers greater than COM9. To
use these ports, change the COM port number using the 'niports' configuration
utility. For more information refer to the manual 'Getting Started with Your 
Serial Hardware and Software for Windows NT'. 

Note 2: For users of PCMCIA 2 port cards
--------------------------------------------------------
You may find that you cannot communicate using your ports even after the
NI Serial Diagnostics passes the ports. To work around this try different
IRQs and different base I/O address combinations.

We appreciate communicating with the people who use our products.  We are
also very interested in hearing about the applications you develop using
our products.
