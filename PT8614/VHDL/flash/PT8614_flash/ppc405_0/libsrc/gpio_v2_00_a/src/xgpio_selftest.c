* Run a self-test on the driver/device. This function does a minimal test 
* in which the data register is read. It only does a read without any kind
* of test because the hardware has been parameterized such that it may be only
* an input such that the state of the inputs won't be known.  
*
* All other hardware features of the device are not guaranteed to be in the 
* hardware since they are parameterizable. 
*
* ARGUMENTS:
*
* @param InstancePtr is a pointer to the XGpio instance to be worked on.
*        This parameter must have been previously initialized with
*        XGpio_Initialize().
*
* @return
*
* XST_SUCCESS always. If the GPIO device was not present in the hardware a bus
* error could be generated. Other indicators of a bus error, such as registers
* in bridges or buses, may be necessary to determine if this function caused
* a bus error.
