Changes to original 5201 test program:


1. There are two test modes (and two main buttons):
   'Total Test' and 'Individual Test'.
   
   Under total test, all tests are performed sequentialy, the sequence is
   that of Apx. 1.  The main menu is grayed, except for 'Betjening', which 
   is accessible under total test while a test procedure is not running, i.e.
   while program waits for user's interaction.
   
   Under individual test, the main menu is active and user can choose 
   individual tests as in original version of the program.
   

2. Under total test, the number of test that fails is remembered.
   The program returns to start panel.  After the fail is corrected and
   user enters total test again, the test that failed is entered
   immediately, without repeating tests that went OK.
   
3. The main panel has a window with nmes of all tests that are run under 
   total test.  Names of tests that went OK are highlighted, so that, if 
   the total test is interrupted, user can see which tests went OK.
