Problem with BB DAC

When calibrating 5201 BBs, there is a problem with BB DAC.
Under calibration we calculate optimal settings for 
BB DACGain Value, BB DACOffset and BB DACLevel for both systems,
PAL and NTSC.  

Those values are then saved in 5201 Calibration structure and
stored in NOVRAM.  However, only values calculated for NTSC
are stored under calibration.  Trouble is, that those values
are not optimal for PAL and consequently timing for PAL is not
up to standard.

To remedy this problem we shall:

1. Modify 5201 Calibration structure, so it contains values of
   BB DACGain Value, BB DACOffset and BB DACLevel for both systems,

2. Modify the :FACT:BBx:DAC command (in rs232cmd.c) so that 5201
   can receive these values for both systems and load them into
   Calibration structure.  Probably two separate new commands will
   be needed.

3. Modify the BBInit() function, so that these values are transmitted
   to BBs according to default system set in 5201.  There is only one
   DAC, which works for PAL and NTSC.

4. Modify the SetBBSystem() so that BB DAC values for given system 
   are transmitted to BB.  When user changes system, correct BB DAC
   values will be loaded to BB.

The new software incorporating above modification will be ver. 5.3.

Test program has to modified too, in order to store BB DAC vaues for
both PAL and NTSC (function MakeBBPhaseCal()), using the new FACT
command described in 2.
