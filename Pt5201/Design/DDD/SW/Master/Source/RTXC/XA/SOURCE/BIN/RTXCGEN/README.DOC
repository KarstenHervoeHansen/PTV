07-April-97               README file for \RTXCGEN

The RTXCgen program was originally written using Microsoft C 4.x and has been
ported to other ANSI C compilers  including  Microsoft  5.0,  5.1,  6.0,  and
Borland  C 2.x and Turbo C++ 3.x.  To build the RTXCgen program (rtxcgen.exe)
and  the RTXC  structure size  display program  (sizes.exe), type  "make" for
Borland C/Turbo  C++ or  "nmake -f  makefile.mak" for  Microsoft.   Note, the
makefile  may require changes to some of  the CCFLAG switches in the makefile
for other host compiler toolkits.

To rebuild  the programs from scratch, a  provided clean.bat file will delete
the corresponding obj and exe files.

Also, see rtxcgen.h for notes  on  RTXCgen  cross-compiler  dependencies  and
other configuration options.
