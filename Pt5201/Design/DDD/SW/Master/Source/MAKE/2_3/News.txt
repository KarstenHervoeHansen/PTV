In file LED_HW.C: While the LEDs was in system mode, (call to int SystemsLEDSet( UC state, UC column)), it was possible to use function LEDSet() causing the LEDport to be updated from two different sources. A primitive "semaphor" has been included to prevent LEDSet to actually update the LEDPort. It will however still update the LEDMirror. The error could be noticed while toggling through the opreset by using the front preset key
