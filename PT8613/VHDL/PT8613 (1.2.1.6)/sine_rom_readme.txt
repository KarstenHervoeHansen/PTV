The following files were generated for 'sine_rom' in directory 
F:\PT8613\VHDL\PT8613 (work):

sine_rom.asy:
   Graphical symbol information file. Used by the ISE tools and some
   third party tools to create a symbol representing the core.

sine_rom.edn:
   Electronic Data Netlist (EDN) file containing the information
   required to implement the module in a Xilinx (R) FPGA.

sine_rom.mif:
   Memory Initialization File which is automatically generated by the
   CORE Generator System for some modules when a simulation flow is
   specified. A MIF data file is used to support HDL functional
   simulation of modules which use arrays of values.

sine_rom.sym:
   Please see the core data sheet.

sine_rom.v:
   Verilog wrapper file provided to support functional simulation.
   This file contains simulation model customization data that is
   passed to a parameterized simulation model for the core.

sine_rom.veo:
   VEO template file containing code that can be used as a model for
   instantiating a CORE Generator module in a Verilog design.

sine_rom.vhd:
   VHDL wrapper file provided to support functional simulation. This
   file contains simulation model customization data that is passed to
   a parameterized simulation model for the core.

sine_rom.vho:
   VHO template file containing code that can be used as a model for
   instantiating a CORE Generator module in a VHDL design.

sine_rom.xco:
   CORE Generator input file containing the parameters used to
   regenerate a core.

sine_rom_flist.txt:
   Text file listing all of the output files produced when a customized
   core was generated in the CORE Generator.

sine_rom_readme.txt:
   Text file indicating the files generated and how they are used.

sine_rom_xmdf.tcl:
   Please see the core data sheet.


Please see the Xilinx CORE Generator online help for further details on
generated files and how to use them.
