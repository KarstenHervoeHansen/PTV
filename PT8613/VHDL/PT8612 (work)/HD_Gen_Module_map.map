WARNING:Place:83 - This design either uses more than 8 clock buffers or has
   clock buffers locked into primary and secondary sites. Since only one clock
   buffer output signal from a primary / secondary pair may enter any clock
   region it is necessary to partition the clock logic being driven by these
   clocks into different clock regions. It may be possible through Floorplanning
   all or just part of the logic being driven by the Global clocks to achieve a
   legal placement for this design...................................................
