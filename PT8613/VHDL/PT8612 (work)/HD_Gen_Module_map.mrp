WARNING:Place:83 - This design either uses more than 8 clock buffers or has
   clock buffers locked into primary and secondary sites. Since only one clock
   buffer output signal from a primary / secondary pair may enter any clock
   region it is necessary to partition the clock logic being driven by these
   clocks into different clock regions. It may be possible through Floorplanning
   all or just part of the logic being driven by the Global clocks to achieve a
   legal placement for this design.

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
 103 block(s) removed
 198 block(s) optimized away
 379 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).
