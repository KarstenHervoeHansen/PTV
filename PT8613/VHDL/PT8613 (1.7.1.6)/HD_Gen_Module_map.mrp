   failed to merge with F5 multiplexer
   HD_Gen_Channel_1/video_generator_instance/audio_generation/Mmux__mux0032_2_f5
   .  There is a conflict for the FXMUX.  The design will exhibit suboptimal
   timing.
WARNING:Pack:266 - The function generator

   .  There is a conflict for the FXMUX.  The design will exhibit suboptimal

WARNING:Place:83 - This design either uses more than 8 clock buffers or has
   clock buffers locked into primary and secondary sites. Since only one clock
   buffer output signal from a primary / secondary pair may enter any clock
   region it is necessary to partition the clock logic being driven by these
   clocks into different clock regions. It may be possible through Floorplanning
   all or just part of the logic being driven by the Global clocks to achieve a
   legal placement for this design.
Section 3 - Informational

INFO:MapLib:562 - No environment variables are currently set.

INFO:LIT:244 - All of the single ended outputs in this design are using slew
   rate limited output drivers. The delay on speed critical single ended outputs
   can be dramatically reduced by designating them as fast outputs in the

Section 4 - Removed Logic Summary
---------------------------------
5095 block(s) removed
 100 block(s) optimized away
5419 signal(s) removed

Section 5 - Removed Logic
-------------------------

The trimmed logic report below shows the logic removed from your design due to
sourceless or loadless signals, and VCC or ground connections.  If the removal
of a signal or symbol results in the subsequent removal of an additional signal
or symbol, the message explaining that second removal will be indented.  This
indentation will be repeated as a chain of related logic is removed.

To quickly locate the original cause for the removal of a chain of logic, look
above the place where that logic is listed in the trimming report, then locate
the lines that are least indented (begin at the leftmost edge).
