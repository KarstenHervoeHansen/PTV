Hi Marco.
This item is a key component in an instrument, which we would like to =
keep into production for the next 3 - 4 years. In order to make a "good =
strategy" for this, we will have to investigate the possibilities:

1. Do you have a replacement type?

2. Can you make a "last time production" of some higher quantity i.e. =
2000 pcs.?

3. Can we have all doc. needed for production of the transformer in case =
we have to produce it somewhere else, denmark for example.

4. For the transformer we need an earth clip 4322 021 33950. Do you have =
some left we can buy?

5. For the mu-metal shield we need a shield clip 4022 242 09090. Do you =
have some left we can buy?

That were the questions for today. I hope you may be able to help me.
Best regards
