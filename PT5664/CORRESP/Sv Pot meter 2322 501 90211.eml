No Dianne. One potmeter does not help us very much to day. But mid may =
sounds nice. I have asked GIT Pr=E6st=F8 to manufacture a little serie =
of 30 pcs. of 4008 109 70830 in which the potmeter is used twice. This =
helps us through the month of may.=20
When we receive the lot from Radioparts, Ole Jensen is the man who =
prepares the potmeter and therefore the man you deliver the potmeter to.

Hi Stig,

Regarding these pot meters.  I have spoken once again with Radio parts =
re improving the delivery date.  They have said the expected delivery =
date is now Mid May and there is the possibility that some of these =
items are on there way to the Radio Parts warehouse but has not been =
confirmed. They will confirm via email.
As I have one pot meter on my desk - should I give this item to Torlief =
or whoever is responsible  in having this item prepared for production.

Regards

Dianne Penzo
