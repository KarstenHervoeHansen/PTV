Hi Dianne.
Everything under control!!!!
The "production guys" at teamtec were wrong. We (teamtec) are going to =
cut the spindle at exact 21,5mm (instead of the original 25mm).
Dan is providing GIT with doc and help and a lot of words.
mvh stig

Hi Dianne,

I have again spoken with the stook-attendant in Pr=E6st=F8, and she =
doesn't
understand why they have to be reworked with you, since our production
people say the potmeters are OK as they are. But it is better to be safe
than sorry, so we sent a couple of samples to a guy named Dan with
Protelevision Technologies, and we are presently waiting for his answer.

Kind regards
GI TEAMTEC A/S

Hi Lise,


As PTV will require sufficient time to ensure that all production =
changes
are made to the potmeters for return to GI Teamtec by the 20 June, can =
you
please confirm when GI Teamtec will be sending the potmeters to PTV.

Best regards

Hi Dianne,

I have asked my stock in Pr=E6st=F8 to send these items to you. Could =
you please
arrange that they are back with us before 20th June, since the circuit
boards are arriving on that date.

Thank you in anticipation.
