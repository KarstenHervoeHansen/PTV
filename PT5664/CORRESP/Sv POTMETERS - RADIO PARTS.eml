Salesmen often run faster than their shoes.
If I really want an answer that I can use,. I try to catch their names =
and more important, try to get a written confirmed delivery date.
But it does not work always. I cross my fingers too.
However, I have some questions:
What is the "price pr." at Radioparts?=20
What is the "price pr." at Ecomal?
Right now I think we are going to make 350 pcs. of  64=B4s and 150 of =
the other types. This add up to a total of approx. 800 potentiometers. =
Maybe you can use this in your negotiations.
regards stig

Hi Stig,

The continuing saga of the potmeters...
Radio parts have promised me that 100 pieces will be arriving next =
Wednesday.
Fingers crossed that these items are correct.  He then said that the =
rest would not arrive until mid july......  I=B4ve had conflicting dates =
and do not know what to believe... I spoke to a different person in the =
sales department today at Radio parts.  He confirmed  mid July but =
speaking to someone the other day in the department, they had confirmed =
mid May.

Best regards
