Release Date 2012-07-04.
CRC = 0x81C1


2.00  	BS2012-08-01 Released to Production.

2.00  	BS2012-07-04 Released to long term test.
		Software version updated to 2.0 and I2C Slave will now show the correct version.
		Multiple bug fixes. UART1 has priority. Telnet timeout configured to 2 minutes.
		Fraction counter resets after 200 ticks which has solved the "missing second" problem.
 		SNTP has a timeout that will reset the socket if no packet has arrived for 4 seconds. (Workaround)
		
1.10	BS2012-06-27 Released to production.
		Software WD Disabled.
		Timer 2 functions moved to Timer 4 and Timer 2 interrupt is disabled.
		Timer 2 is now used as baudrate generator for uart 0.
		This prevents a system crash during a DOS attack. There is an issue with sharing Timer 2 with bootloader.
		UBlox msg_buf size changed to 300.
		Telnet inactivity timeout extended to two minutes.

1.09	BS2012-05-23 Debug Version.
		Software WD Enabled.
		Netfinder Protocol Disabled.
		
1.08	BS2012-05-23 Released to production.
		Software WD Enabled.
		UBlox msg_buf moved to XRAM @ 0x1C00.
		Minor changes to Uart 0 buffers and Telnet states.
		
1.07	BS2012-03-05 Debug Version.
		Software WD disabled.

1.06	BS2012-03-05 Released to production.
		Leap year bug fixed.
		Software WD Enabled.

1.05	BS2012-02-29 Debug Version.
		Software WD disabled.
		 
1.04	BS2012-02-29 Released to production.
		Debug disabled.

1.03	BS2012-02-22 Debug version.
		Debug data can be sent to UART0.
		mn_ether_init returns after 1 failed attempt.
		SMBus interrupt no longer have priority.
		Timer 2 interrupt now have priority.
		Timer 2 is now used as a software watchdog timer. (Only enabled while the server is running.)
		Netfinder RTC removed.
		str2COM0 is blocking until data is transmitted.

1.02  	BS2011-04-29 Released to production.
		DHCP renew function changed.
		Interrupt routines that read data larger than a byte is halted while others are writing.

1.01  	BS2011-04-07 Released to production.
		DHCP is now renewed from Server Idle Function.
		DHCP status can be read through Telnet.(@AT+++ -> DHCP)
		GPS Lock Status can now be read trhough Telnet. (@AT+++ -> GPSLOCK)
		A help menu for debug is implemented in Telnet. (@AT+++ -> HELP)

1.00  	BS2011-01-25 Released to production.
		The software version can now be read from the Diagnostic menu on the PT5300.

0.09  	BS2011-01-21 Released to production.
		The NetFinder name is loaded to RAM during startup and restart. If read directly from flash the NetFinder menu
		would show square signs if no network cable was connected.

0.08  	BS2011-01-21 Released to production.
		DHCP to I2C fixed. if DHCP_Enable <> 0 then DHCP_Endble := 1;

0.07    BS2011-01-10 Development version.
		Released to production.
		Function ntp_process_packet() changed in order to find the "missing" second.
		Tests suggest that there might be a bug in NTP-Client.EXE. The missing second always appear in the same 
		request number every time though different request numbers on different computers.

0.06  	BS2011-01-07 Released to production.
		Netfinder and Telnet security issue fixed.
		The CP2200 flash init byte has been changed to 0x02 because of changes to the flash memory map.

0.04	BS2011-01-06 Development version.
		RS232 command timeout adjusted to 5000.
		tcp_resend_ticks raised to 20.

0.03	BS2011-01-05 Development version.
		Leapseconds implemented.
		Command GPSSTATUS implemented for Telnet in command mode.

0.02	BS 2010-12-16 Development version.
		Released to production.
		Leap seconds must be implemented correctly when we have working hardware.
