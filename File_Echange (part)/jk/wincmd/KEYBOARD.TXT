Command line: keys

If Windows Commander is active, nearly all keyboard
input is directed to the command line.
Here the layout for some keys:


ENTER       The command line is executed, if it 
            contains at least one character (otherwise,
            the program under the cursor in the source
            window is started). If the command is cd,
            md or rd, it is executed internally. If it
            is an internal DOS command, DOS will be 
            executed with this command. Otherwise, a
            program with the given name is executed.
SHIFT-ENTER Like ENTER, but with preceding command /c.
            After the called DOS program is terminated,
            its window is not automatically closed. This
            will only work if the file noclose.pif is in
            your windows directory.
CTRL-ENTER  The file under the cursor in the source 
            directory is appended to the command line.
CTRL-SHIFT-ENTER
            The file under the cursor including its path
            is appended to the command line.
CTRL-CURSORDOWN
or ALT+F8   A list with the latest command lines (history-
            list) is opened. Hold down the CTRL key and 
            use the up and down cursor keys to select an
            entry. By pressing the left or right key, you
            can edit the command line. This automatically
            closes the list.

TAB         Puts the cursor back to the source directory.
Cursor keys Cursor left and cursor right move the cursor
            through the command line, even if the cursor
            was in the source directory before. If brief
            was selected, these keys move the cursor
            through the source directory. You then have to
            hold down SHIFT to move it inside the command
            line.
            Cursor up and cursor down move the cursor bar
            inside the source window, even if it was inside
            the command line.
ESC,CTRL+Y  Clears the command line.
CTRL+E      Copy previous command to command line
CTRL+K      Delete to end of line
CTRL+W      Delete word to the left of the cursor
CTRL+T      Delete word to the right of the cursor
