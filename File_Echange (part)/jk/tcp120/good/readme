This directory contains sources for TCP server and client to be 
run on F120 Silabs Kit (cli.c and srv.c)

They are modified Silabs examples of Ethernet\TCP.

Both programs have netfinder routines linked, so they can be
discovered by C220x Netfinder.

They both use Silabs DHCP functions to obtain IP address.

Directory PC contains modified Silabs examples for TCP client
and server to be run on a PC together with the above porgrams.

The client program may have Silabs kit's IP address input via 
command line.
