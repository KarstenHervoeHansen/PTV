This software has been written entirely in BC++ 3.0, without any use of
3rd party libraries etc.

All graphics are programmed utilizing Borlands Graphical Interface, BGI.

To initialize the serial COM port the statement intr( 0x14) is used while
the statements inportb() and outputb() is used to communicate with the RS232
port. This communication is interrupt controlled hence the SW takes control
over the COM port interrupts.
The SW also takes control over the time tick routine and reroutes the interrupt vector.
