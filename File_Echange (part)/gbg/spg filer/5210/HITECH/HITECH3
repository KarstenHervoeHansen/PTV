Thank You for the advice concerning interrupts in the XA.

I tried to patch the optimizer with your patch file but i got
the message 'error ept0009: Invalid Patch File  'PATCH.RTP'.
What is the '32 bit version'?

I managed to make the 'hole' again in INTEL HEX output in V7.60
from address 35532h. (as I wrote in my first letter).
I have attached my files.

When I re-make my job with V7.60 and use .bin as output, the
output file looks OK but it does not function properly. First
of all it is completely different from that produced by V7.55

I get the suspicion that my copy of HPDXA V7.60 is not copied
correctly from your website (XA760.EXE size:2213858). I will
try a new download.

Regards, Preben
