Thank you for a very fast answer to my E-mail!

MISSING DATA IN HEX OUTPUT:
What a fool I am!  The 'Signetics' format I mentioned is MOTOROLA!
(The 'S' in each line tricked me).
I have not been able to produce the 'hole' in output data in
version 7.60 again, but indeed in ver. 7.55. Perhaps the (some-
times chaotic) shifting back and forth between the two versions
made me jump to a false conclusion - sorry!


But I still cannot get the menu 'output file format...' to work
in ver. 7.60.
'ARROW-UP' moves selection down, 'ARROW-DOWN' removes selection,
'ESC' moves selection up in the sceme. ENTER leaves the menu but
does not seem to save the new selection. Use of the mouse does'nt
help.
I have managed to Re-Link to several output formats by editing
the project file in the line  'OuputFormat: 1'  by changing the
number, entering HPDXA and clicking RESET in Make/Objtohex,
as you proposed. It seems that the options are not listed in
the manual?


I like the clever project handling in HPDXA but when I shift to
another project with ALT-P I mostly get the error message:
'internal error: attemp to free NULL pointer'. It takes a few
pushes on ESC and ENTER to escape from this message.


The setting up of the XA is difficult (to me), especially regarding
interrupts and I have searched the Internet to get some example files
where most of the interrupts are used, but I did not find any. Can
You help?.

Regards,  Preben.
