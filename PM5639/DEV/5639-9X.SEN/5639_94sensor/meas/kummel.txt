Dear Mr. Berendt,
 
thank you for your email.
Here are the answers to your questions:
The restlessness increases with fading brightness of the LCD panel - it is the same on a CRT monitor. 
I observed these oscillations very well in the xy-chromaticity diagram:
for luminance values of  Y >= 37 cd/m  the values of the x,y coordinates are quiet - only luminance Y has small changes, for Y < 6 cd/m  there is a greater increase of the restlessness for x,y and rather strong at minimum brightness of 2,2 cd/m on the LCD panel. The integration time hereby was 6,25 ms ( 10 measurements/s).
 
In detail:
With Y nearly 0,5 cd/m (on a CRT monitor)     ==>     x = 0,22 ... 0,25        y = 0,21 ... 0,26
 
At total darkness the values don't become zero - I think, there is a great noise in the sensor!
With greater integration time the restlessness becomes a little bit smaller.
The old sensor /93 shows no variation of the measurement values whatever at darkness, and still small variation at white pictures only in luminance Y. 
Sorry - but I can't understand the meaning of your last question: How does ... Could you repeat it with other words?
 
Best regards
