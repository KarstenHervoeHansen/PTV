
This directory contains sources for 5639 display unit 
modified to accept miniature LCD sensor '94.

This sensor has special software which is different
from '93 software.  There is also a separate calibration
program for '94 sensor.  As a consequence, when '94
sensor was used with 5639 display unit, the luminance
value was 10 times lower than it should be.

The modification consists of an algorithm which identifies
'94 sensor and multiplies luminance by 10.

The '94 sensor has sensor ID located at memory location 61
set to 57.  This is done in special calibration sorfware
for '94 sensor, which also was modified.  Then the value of
sensor ID of 57 is used to identify '94 sensor in this 
software.

Kiel 8051 Compiler version 3.20 was used.

The output file of this project, res.bin, is used as
4008 002 0155 and replaces file 400 002 0154, used hitherto.

Software version is 2.5.

30.06.2003: JK


18.08.2003: Released as version 2.6: JK '94 luminance < 1.0 bug 
            fixed.
