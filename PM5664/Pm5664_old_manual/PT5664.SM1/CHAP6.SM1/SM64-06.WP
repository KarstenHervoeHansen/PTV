@OVERSKRIFT 1 = 6. CRT Control - Unit 2
The CRT Control unit consists of 6 potentiometers (of which 5 are accessible from the front of the instrument) and LEDs for ON and GAMUT indication. The potentiometers are used to control the Intensity, Astigmatism, Focus voltage of the CRT, Trace rotation, and the Illumination of the graticule light. The last potentiometer, which is not access-ible from the front of the instrument, is used for adjustment of the MENU intensity.

Diode D1 reduces drift of the intensity.
